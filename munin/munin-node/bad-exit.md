It appears that you're encountering issues when trying to fetch data from the `apache_processes` plugin on your Munin node. The "Bad exit" message typically indicates that there was a problem executing the command or retrieving data from the plugin. Here are some steps you can take to troubleshoot and resolve this issue:

1. **Verify Plugin Configuration:**
   Ensure that the `apache_processes` plugin is correctly installed and configured on the Munin node. Sometimes, plugins may require additional configuration parameters such as the location of Apache server status or specific permissions.

2. **Check Munin Node Logs:**
   Look into the logs of the Munin node (`munin-node.log` typically located in `/var/log/munin/`) for any error messages or warnings related to the `apache_processes` plugin. This can provide clues about what might be going wrong.

3. **Restart Munin Node Service:**
   Restart the Munin node service to ensure that any configuration changes or updates to plugins are applied correctly:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart munin-node
   ```

4. **Test Connectivity and Permissions:**
   Ensure that the Munin client (the system where you're running the commands) has proper network connectivity to the Munin node (`xmlpipedb2024`) and that there are no firewall rules or network issues blocking communication.

5. **Check Plugin Execution Permissions:**
   Verify that the user executing the Munin commands has sufficient permissions to access the Munin node and execute plugins. Sometimes, this may involve running commands with elevated privileges (using `sudo`).

6. **Verify Plugin Output:**
   Manually check the output of the `apache_processes` plugin on the Munin node. You can typically do this by running the plugin command directly on the command line of the Munin node to see if it produces any errors or unexpected output.

7. **Update Munin and Plugins:**
   Ensure that both Munin and its plugins are up to date. Outdated plugins or Munin installations can sometimes lead to compatibility issues or bugs that cause commands to fail.

By systematically checking these points and troubleshooting steps, you should be able to diagnose and resolve the "Bad exit" issue with fetching data from the `apache_processes` plugin on your Munin node. If the issue persists, reviewing detailed logs and consulting Munin documentation or support resources may provide further insights.
