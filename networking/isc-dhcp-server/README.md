Configuring a DHCP server on Ubuntu Linux to serve a basic subnet configuration for the network `10.0.0.0` with a subnet mask accommodating up to 255 hosts involves setting up the DHCP server software (usually ISC DHCP server) and then defining the subnet, range of IP addresses to be distributed, and other relevant settings in the DHCP server's configuration file.

Here's a basic guide to get you started:

1. **Install the DHCP Server:**

   First, you'll need to install the ISC DHCP server package if it's not already installed on your system. Open a terminal and run:

   ```bash
   sudo apt-get update
   sudo apt-get install isc-dhcp-server
   ```

2. **Configure the DHCP Server:**

   The main configuration file for the DHCP server is located at `/etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf`. You'll need to edit this file to define your subnet and the range of IP addresses that the DHCP server should allocate to clients.

   Open the configuration file in a text editor with root privileges:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/dhcp/dhcpd.conf
   ```

   Then, add the following configuration to set up a subnet `10.0.0.0` with a netmask of `255.255.255.0` (which supports up to 254 hosts, since one address is used for the network address and another for the broadcast address). This example configures the DHCP server to distribute IP addresses from `10.0.0.10` to `10.0.0.254`:

   ```dhcp
   subnet 10.0.0.0 netmask 255.255.255.0 {
       range 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.254;
       option routers 10.0.0.1;
       option subnet-mask 255.255.255.0;
       option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;
       option domain-name "yourdomain.local";
       default-lease-time 600;
       max-lease-time 7200;
   }
   ```

   - `range 10.0.0.10 10.0.0.254;` specifies the range of IP addresses that will be allocated to clients.
   - `option routers 10.0.0.1;` defines the default gateway for the subnet. This is typically the router's IP address.
   - `option domain-name-servers 8.8.8.8, 8.8.4.4;` specifies the DNS servers to be used by the clients. In this example, Google's public DNS servers are used.
   - Adjust `option domain-name`, `default-lease-time`, and `max-lease-time` as needed for your environment.

3. **Assign the DHCP Server to an Interface:**

   You'll need to specify on which network interface the DHCP server should listen. This is configured in `/etc/default/isc-dhcp-server`. Open this file:

   ```bash
   sudo nano /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
   ```

   Find the `INTERFACESv4` directive and assign your network interface (e.g., `eth0`):

   ```bash
   INTERFACESv4="eth0"
   ```

   If you're not sure which interface to use, you can list all available network interfaces by running `ip addr`.

4. **Restart the DHCP Server:**

   After configuring the DHCP server, restart it to apply the changes:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart isc-dhcp-server
   ```

5. **Verify the DHCP Server Status:**

   Check the status of the DHCP server to ensure it's running properly:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl status isc-dhcp-server
   ```

This basic setup should get your DHCP server up and running for the specified subnet. Remember to adjust the configuration according to your network requirements and security policies.
